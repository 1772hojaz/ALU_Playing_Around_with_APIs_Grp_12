## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort to design and develop a small web application that leverages external APIs to fetch and display relevant data. The primary focus is on functionality, utilizing APIs from various categories to demonstrate a range of capabilities.

## Features

- Language translation between various supported languages.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Demonstrates API integration principles.

## APIs Used

The application utilizes the Google Translate API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) for language translation.

## Demo

The video would explain in detail the workings of the app. Check out our [demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/60e79520707b4ca59752a639647cc6ac?sid=7b7f1d01-8de4-46e5-b158-379894d574e9) for a quick overview of how to use the application.
